# Supplier_Inventory_Cost_Simulation
This notebook performs a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate and compare the total supply chain cost (holding and shortage) of sourcing from three suppliers. Using real-world delivery time data from a B2B order dataset, the simulation models daily inventory management over a 180-day period, considering uncertainty in customer demand.
